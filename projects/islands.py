# Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and
# returns the number of 1 islands.
# An island consists of 1s that are connected to the 
# north, south, east or west. For example:

islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

# island_counter(islands) -> returns 4
